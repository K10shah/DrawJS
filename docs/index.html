            Hi! If you are a coder and ever wanted to make a game (do i even have to say the second part?), you probably came across the whole canvas thing.
            Yes, it is weird and overly complicated, and no, you are not alone who thinks that. So here, an attempt, at least, to make more sense of it is
            DrawJS. We are wrapping the core canvas functions in an easy-to-use format and gradually adding cool features to speed up development.<br><br>
            Games are not the only thing where you can use this library, of course, anything you would normally want to visualize is doable. We are always
            interested in seeing what you come up with, so if you use Draw in one of your projects, contact us, and we will add you to a hall of fame.<br><br>
            'But how is this different from p5?' I hear you ask. I mean not literally, this website is <i>totally</i> not listening through the microphone.
            The goal here is not a complete framework, with physics simulation and whatnot. I mean you can write those yourself is you want to. This library
            is just here to simplify drawing things on a canvas.<br><br>
        </div>



        <div class="learn-c" id="learn-c">
            DrawJS is not super hard to learn. The basic funcionality is all abstracted away
            for you so you won't have to memorize the obscure canvas API.
            
            We have an extensive documentation 
            <a href="https://github.com/RazorSh4rk/DrawJS/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#writing-text">here</a>. All the current features are searchable
            and organized.

            You can see the example in action here: 
            <br><canvas id="animal-canv"></canvas><br>

            Draw is also perfectly good for making small games. Here is an example of a
            Ludum Dare entry written with DrawJS:
            <br><iframe src="https://razorsh4rk.github.io/that-game-with-bullets-and-food/"></iframe><br>


            Displaying data is also easy, for example take a look at the rating of the last 
            20 Studio Ghibli films. (The 41 is Tales from Earthsea, I know you are interested
            about that.)
            <br><canvas id="ghibli-canv"></canvas><br>

            All of these sources are available <a href="./canv.js">here.</a>
            The game has a bit more code, <a href="https://github.com/RazorSh4rk/that-game-with-bullets-and-food">check it out</a>.
        </div>



        <div class="download-c" id="download-c">
            The easiest way to use Draw is to include it from a cdn:
            <p class="code">
                &lt;script src="https://rawgit.com/RazorSh4rk/DrawJS/master/draw.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            </p>
            You can also download the repo and use the .js file:
            <p class="code">
                <a href="https://github.com/RazorSh4rk/DrawJS/archive/master.zip">click</a>
            </p>
            If you decide to use Draw in production (yay), use the minified sources.
            <p class="code">
                &lt;script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/RazorSh4rk/DrawJS/8fe13774/draw.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                <br><br>
                &lt;script src="https://rawgit.com/RazorSh4rk/DrawJS/master/draw.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            </p>

        <div class="contribute-c" id="contribute-c">
            Every contribution is welcome. There is no clear roadmap, if some new possible
            feature comes up, it will be added to the GitHub kanban board. If you have a 
            free hour and want to help out, you are welcome to.
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            That being said, there are a few guidelines. Try to follow the current coding style.
            Do not use JS hacks (or at least not extensively). If you want to add a feature that
            is not strongly connected to drawing things (e.g. sounds), do so in a separate file.
            I will take care of minification and cdn deployment, don't worry about that. If you
            add a new feature, please document it, or ask for documentation in your pull request.
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            You can help with other stuff too, you might have noticed that I'm not great with web
            design, so if you want to revamp this site, that would be cool.
